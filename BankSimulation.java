// BankSimulation.java
//
// CSC --- Concurrency Bottleneck Diagnosis, Level 1
// -------------------------------------------------
// This program pretends to simulate multiple ATM withdrawals against a shared bank account.
// It is intentionally buggy for teaching purposes.
//
// Known (intentional) problems for students to find and explain:
// 1. Race condition on shared balance (multiple threads read/modify/write without sync)
// 2. Possible negative balance (business logic failure)
// 3. Inconsistent final balance between runs
// 4. Inefficient CPU usage (spin loop pretending to be "work")
// 5. Manual Thread management instead of a safer executor model
//
// Your job (student) is to:
//  - Run the program several times and observe different outputs.
//  - Explain WHY the balance is inconsistent.
//  - Propose at least two code-level fixes.

        // In your report:
        //  1. What's the core concurrency bug called?
        //  2. Where does it actually happen in code?
        //  3. Under what timing conditions does it show up?
        //  4. Propose at least TWO fixes.
        //
        // Suggested directions for fixes:
        //  - Add 'synchronized' / locks around withdraw()
        //  - Use thread-safe classes / AtomicInteger
        //  - Use an ExecutorService instead of manually new Thread(...)
        //  - Remove / redesign fakeWork() to stop wasting CPU
        //
        // Also include your AI Reflection:
        //  - Did you ask an AI to help debug?
        //  - What did it get right/wrong?
        //  - Did you trust it blindly or verify?
